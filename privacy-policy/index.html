You can also adjust the settings on your computer to decline any cookies if you wish;</li><li>over the phone, if you tell us information about you;</li><li>from a third party engaged by you (such as a web developer);</li><li>when you enter a competition or promotion with us, participate in a survey or register to receive information from us or register to receive information on any of our Services.</li></ul>
<p>If at any time you supply Personal Information to us about any person other than yourself, you represent and we accept that information on the basis that you are authorised to do so and that the relevant person has consented to the disclosure to us.</p>
<p>This privacy statement only covers the collection of Personal Information by our sites only and does not cover the collection of Personal Information from other third parties you access via a hyperlink or otherwise on our sites, whether or not affiliated with us.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>If at any time you no longer wish to receive any additional marketing material from us or do not want your information disclosed for direct marketing purposes, contact us using the details in section 11 and we will remove your details from our marketing database.</p>
<p><strong>6. Disclosing personal information</strong></p>
<p>We may be required to disclose your Personal Information by law, by court order or to investigate suspected fraud or other unlawful activity.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties in certain circumstances including:</p>
<ul><li>if you agree to the disclosure;</li><li>when we use it for the purpose for which it was collected, e.g. to provide you with Services;</li><li>in circumstances where you would reasonably be expected to consent to information of that kind being passed to a third party;</li><li>where disclosure is required or permitted by law;</li><li>where it is required to be disclosed for audit purposes;</li><li>to our Related Entities;</li><li>if disclosure will prevent or lessen a serious or imminent threat to someone’s life or health; or</li><li>where it is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law, a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue.</li></ul>
<p>When we disclose your Personal Information to our third-party service providers, we will attempt to ensure that those service providers have reasonable data security policies and practices in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>7. Jurisdiction and Cross-Border Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Due to the nature of the Services provided, your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers, and we may transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of your country of residence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These countries may have different privacy and data protection rules to those of Australia and/or your country. However, we will endeavour to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable laws and that your Personal Information remains protected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or other official authorities in those countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Considerations when you send information to us</strong></p>
<p>While we do all we reasonably can to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, including investing in security software, no data transfer over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
<p>The open nature of the Internet is such that information exchanged via the Internet may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. If you send us any information, including (without limitation) Personal Information, it is sent at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you provide Personal Information to us electronically, there are steps you can take to help maintain the information’s privacy.&nbsp; These include:</p>
<ul><li>always closing your browser when you have finished your session;</li><li>NEVER providing Personal Information by using a public computer; and</li><li>NEVER disclosing your user name and password to another person.</li></ul>
<p>You are responsible for all actions taken using your username, email or password. If at any time you believe your username or password has been compromised, you should immediately contact us and also change your password.</p>
<p>You should also contact us immediately if you believe:</p>
<ul><li>someone has gained access to your Personal Information;</li><li>we have breached our privacy obligations or your privacy rights in any way; or</li><li>you would like to discuss any issues about our Privacy Policy.</li></ul>
<p><strong>9. How your information is stored</strong></p>
<p>We endeavour to keep our information systems and files secured from unauthorised access.&nbsp; Those who work with us, including our third-party service providers are aware of the importance we place on protecting your privacy and their role in helping us to do so.</p>
<p>Our procedures to securely store Personal Information include electronic and physical security measures, staff training and use of password protection software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Personal Information that we collect is no longer required, we will remove or de-identify the Personal Information as soon as reasonably possible.&nbsp; We may, however, retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary to comply with any applicable law, for the prevention of fraud, for insurance and governance purposes, in our IT back-up, for the collection of any monies owed and to resolve disputes. There may also be residual Personal Information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10. How you can update, correct, or delete your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>You may request access to your Personal Information or correct any inaccurate or out of date information by contacting our Privacy Officer using the details below.&nbsp; For security purposes, before we provide you with personal information, we will ask you to provide evidence of your identity.</p>
<p>You may request the source of any information we collect from a third party.&nbsp; We will provide this at no cost, unless under the Privacy Act or other law there is a reason for this information being withheld.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a reason under the Privacy Act or other law for us not to provide you with information, we will give you a written notice of refusal setting out the reasons for the refusal except to the extent it would be unreasonable to do so and the mechanisms available to you to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p><strong>11. Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
